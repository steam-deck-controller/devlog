# Steam Deck Controller* Devlog
Development progress / details not shown in the other repositories for the curious.

## First Steps
Reddit Post by Roni: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/1fgzst6/steam_deck_controller_self_build_searching_for/

The post was about:
- The explanation of the project
- Search for donor Steam Decks and people to work with

Lots of comments and upvotes later a few people showed interest in working together creating our team.

## Init
Roni made a Discord server for the team to talk to each other and invited various people who he reached out to via Reddit or other means.

A GitHub repository was also created for the project: https://github.com/Roni1993/steam-deck-controller

The initial team consisted of:

- Roni
- Alia5
- Crunchy
- NKkrisz

After this, discussions began happening on how to make this project a reality.
